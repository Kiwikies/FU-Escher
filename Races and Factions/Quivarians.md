In the ethereal realm of the floating islands that are the [[Highlands]] of [[Escher]], the Quivarians thrive as a beacon of commerce and innovation amidst the clouds. With their sprawling cities of gleaming spires and bustling marketplaces, the Quivarians have established themselves as a hub of trade and exchange, attracting beings from all corners of the world to their lofty abodes.

Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, the Quivarians of the [[Highlands]] possess a unique blend of magic and technology, seamlessly integrating the two disciplines to achieve feats that defy conventional understanding. From enchanting their towering structures with arcane energies to imbuing their machinery with the power of elemental forces, the Quivarians have harnessed the synergistic potential of magic and technology to create a society of unparalleled ingenuity and advancement.

At the heart of Quivarian culture lies a deep reverence for knowledge and discovery. Scholars and artisans alike devote themselves to the pursuit of enlightenment, constantly seeking to unravel the mysteries of the world and push the boundaries of what is possible. It is this insatiable thirst for understanding that drives the Quivarians to explore the realms of both magic and technology, unlocking secrets that have long remained hidden from mortal eyes.

Yet, in recent times, the tranquillity of the Quivarian cities has been shattered by a dark and insidious threat. The [[Faekind]], they have infiltrated the floating islands, their malevolent presence casting a shadow over the once-vibrant streets and bustling marketplaces. The [[Faekind]] have seized control of key strategic locations within the cities, threatening to plunge the Quivarian society into chaos and despair.
