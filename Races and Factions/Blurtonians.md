In the untamed wilderness of [[Escher]], the Blurtonians roam as a fierce and resilient tribe of dog-like beings, their lives shaped by the harsh rhythms of survival and the primal instincts that course through their veins. With fur as wild as the windswept plains and eyes that gleam with the fire of untamed spirits, the Blurtonians embody the untamed spirit of the wild.

As a nomadic people, the Blurtonians traverse the vast expanse of [[Escher]]'s wilderness, their existence defined by the relentless pursuit of sustenance and the thrill of the hunt. Each member of their tribe is forged in the crucible of adversity, honing their skills as warriors and hunters to navigate the dangers of their unforgiving world.

But what truly sets the Blurtonians apart is their unique ability to reincarnate. When a leader of a warband falls in battle, their spirit is believed to be reborn into the body of another member of the tribe, ensuring that their legacy lives on through the generations. This belief in the cyclical nature of existence shapes the Blurtonians' worldview, instilling them with a sense of resilience and determination that transcends the boundaries of mortality.

Upon the death of a warband leader, if any member of the tribe survives, they undertake a solemn ritual to honor their fallen comrade. Erecting a village in the leader's memory, they choose to embrace a life of peace, seeking solace in the bonds of community and the comforts of home. It is a testament to the Blurtonians' reverence for their fallen leaders and their commitment to preserving the memory of those who have come before.

Despite their proud and fierce nature, the Blurtonians harbour no resentment towards the [[CoQlings]] for the genocide committed against their people in times past. Instead, they view it as a testament to their own strength and resilience, proof that they are a tribe capable of enduring even the darkest of trials. For the Blurtonians, the scars of their past serve as a reminder of the indomitable spirit that courses through their veins, driving them ever forward in the pursuit of freedom and survival amidst the untamed beauty of [[Escher]]'s wilderness.
