In the serene landscapes of the shores and wetlands of [[Escher]], the CoQlings thrive as a race of amphibious beings, their lives intricately woven with the ebb and flow of the tides. With sleek, iridescent skin and webbed appendages perfectly adapted for both land and sea, they navigate their watery domain with effortless grace, their existence shaped by the rhythm of the waves and the whisper of the wind.

But beneath the surface of their seemingly idyllic society lies a darker truth. Long ago, the CoQlings came into possession of advanced technology, gifted to them by mysterious extra-terrestrial beings. This technological prowess elevated the CoQlings to unparalleled heights, allowing them to construct magnificent coastal cities and harness the power of the ocean depths.

Yet, this power came at a cost. As their reliance on technology grew, the CoQlings became increasingly distrustful of magic, viewing it as a chaotic force that threatened to disrupt the delicate balance of their society. Those few among their kind who demonstrated an affinity for magic were marginalized, their abilities feared and shunned, those with affinity are risen to positions of power.

Central to the CoQlings' belief system is their reverence for Quetzalcoatl, a deity whose majestic form mirrors their own, yet embodies the magnificence of the natural world on a grand scale. As the guardian of the land and sea, Quetzalcoatl is worshipped by the CoQlings as a symbol of wisdom and strength, guiding them through the trials of existence with its watchful gaze.

However, this reverence for their deity did not prevent the CoQlings from committing a grave atrocity. Fuelled by fear and paranoia, they unleashed a genocide upon the race of [[Blurtonians]], a nomadic tribe whose rumoured power of reincarnation posed a perceived threat to their dominance. In a brutal campaign of violence and oppression, the CoQlings sought to eradicate the [[Blurtonians]] from existence, fearing the potential consequences of their supposed ability to return from death.

As the echoes of their dark deeds reverberate through the annals of history, the CoQlings grapple with the moral implications of their actions, haunted by the spectre of their own hubris. And amidst the tranquil beauty of their coastal cities and the mist-laden wetlands that fringe their shores, the CoQlings are forced to confront the shadows that lurk within their own hearts, grappling with the consequences of their descent into darkness.
