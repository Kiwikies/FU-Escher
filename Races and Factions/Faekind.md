Faekind emerge as a formidable force, human invaders whose arrival on [[Escher]] heralded an era of darkness and uncertainty. Through the use of powerful portals, they breach the barriers between worlds, their presence a harbinger of chaos and upheaval.

Led by [[The Sovereign]], physically imposing and possessed of an innate strength that surpasses that of the native inhabitants of [[Escher]], the Faekind stand as formidable adversaries on the battlefield. Clad in armour forged from otherworldly metals and wielding weapons of devastating power, they strike fear into the hearts of those who dare to oppose them.

But it is not just their martial prowess that sets the Faekind apart; it is their ability to negate magic and technology with a mere presence. The stronger the Faekind, the larger their field of negation, rendering even the most advanced spells and machinery useless in their wake. This ability to nullify the very foundations of [[Escher]]'s society grants them a tactical advantage unlike any other, allowing them to swiftly subdue resistance and assert their dominance over the land.

With the conquest of the [[Quivarians]] cities in the [[Highlands]], the Faekind establish a foothold in [[Escher]], their presence casting a shadow over the once-vibrant streets and bustling marketplaces. Despite their status as invaders, they impose a semblance of order upon the conquered cities, allowing the native inhabitants to continue their lives as they normally would, albeit under the watchful gaze of their new overlords.

However, this semblance of normalcy comes at a price. The Faekind levy exorbitant charges upon those who wish to enter the cities, as well as exploiting their control over the [[Landpiercer]] to enrich themselves at the expense of the [[Escher]] people. Moreover, any act of defiance or rebellion is swiftly met with harsh reprisals, with punishment often taking the form of a swift and merciless death.

As the Faekind expand their dominion to encompass the cities of the [[Blurtonians]] and [[CoQlings]] in the [[Lowlands]], the native inhabitants find themselves faced with a stark choice: submit to the will of their new overlords or risk the wrath of their unstoppable might. And amidst the turmoil and upheaval that grips the world of [[Escher]], the fate of its people hangs in the balance, their hopes for liberation overshadowed by the specter of tyranny and oppression.
