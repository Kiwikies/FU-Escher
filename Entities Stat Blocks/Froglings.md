The Frogling is a cunning predator, known for its stealthy movements and lightning-fast strikes. With its long, sticky tongue and razor-sharp teeth, it lies in wait among the reeds and marshes, patiently stalking its prey before launching itself into a swift and deadly attack, favouring the [[CoQlings]] young.
