In the vast expanse of the [[Lowlands]], amidst the untamed wilderness and treacherous terrain, the Land Train thunders across the landscape like a juggernaut of steel and magic. Crafted by the ingenious hands of the [[CoQlings]], this marvel of engineering represents the pinnacle of technological innovation, a massive locomotive propelled forward by the combined forces of magic and machinery.

The Land Train is a sight to behold, its towering form stretching across the horizon as it rumbles along the tracks that wind through the rugged landscape. Powered by a complex network of arcane energies and mechanical engines, it serves as a lifeline for travellers and traders seeking safe passage through the perilous wilderness of the [[Lowlands]].

Yet, despite its origins as a creation of the[[ CoQlings]], the Land Train now finds itself under the control of the [[Faekind]], human invaders who have seized control of the [[Quivarian]] cities in the [[Highlands]]. With their ability to negate magic and technology, the Faekind have subjugated the [[CoQlings]] and bent their creations to their will, using the Land Train as a means of exerting their dominion over the land.

Under [[Faekind]] control, the Land Train has become a symbol of oppression and tyranny, its massive form serving as a constant reminder of the invaders' iron grip on the land. Travelers who dare to board the train do so at their own peril, for the [[Faekind]] enforce strict regulations and impose harsh penalties upon those who dare to defy their authority.

Yet, despite the [[Faekind]]'s control over the Land Train, whispers of resistance still echo through the [[Lowlands]]. Brave souls stand ready to challenge the invaders and reclaim their freedom, their determination and courage serving as a beacon of hope in the face of tyranny, whispers abound that the [[The Resistance]] is based on the Land Train.

As the Land Train thunders across the landscape, its wheels grinding against the tracks and arcane steam billowing from its mighty engine, it serves as a reminder of the struggle that defines life in the [[Lowlands]]. For amidst the chaos and uncertainty of [[Escher]], the fate of its people hangs in the balance, their hopes for liberation intertwined with the relentless march of progress and the forces of darkness that seek to engulf the land.
